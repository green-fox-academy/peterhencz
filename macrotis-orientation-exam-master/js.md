SELECT manufacturerName, acquisitionPrice
    FROM CarsForSale WHERE manufacturerName = 'Renault' AND acquisitionPrice > 8000;

2.


UPDATE table_name
SET acquisitionPrice = acquisitionPrice - 100
WHERE manufacturerName = 'Volkswagen';




## optional) Endpoint TESTing

 -  You should create a test case that the endpoint returns with a `200` status code for each endpoint
 -  Create a test case for a not existing endpoint, you should expect `404` status code
 -  You should create a test case for the `/filter` endpoint with `restaurant` category, it should have `?` number in the `count` and the first item's name should be `Kerkyra`
